Advanced reference on BaSh pipes and redirections.

# Introduction

After reading this page, you should be able to:

* Fork and join subprocesses
* Redirect to multiple streams
* Capture outputs to variable without blocking nor afecting the standard output

There are many tutorials on shell pipes on the net but most use the very basic syntax
like the following [useless use of cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29#Useless_use_of_cat).

```bash
cat file.txt | sed -i s/country/state/g'
```

There is some advanced content on redirections, but it is spread between
the [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)
and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bbash%5D+pipe),
see for example:

* [How to get the output of a shell function without forking a sub shell?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7502981/how-to-get-the-output-of-a-shell-function-without-forking-a-sub-shell/75065137#75065137)

## Debug

TODO

If you want to go futher, inspect the current state of your shell while running the examples:

```bash
ls -l /proc/self/fd  # or /proc/$$/fd/
for fd in $(ls /proc/$$/fd| grep -v [012]); do exec {fd}>&-; done  # Close fd except std streams
exec bash  # Renew, shell but fd are kept
```

# Single pipeline

## Manual

From: __man bash / SHELL GRAMMAR / Pipeline__
From: __man 7 pipe__

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:

```text
[time [-p]] [ ! ] command [ [|âŽª|&] command2 ... ]
```

The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2. This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below). If |& is used, command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |. This implicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command.


## Examples

```bash
# Replace recursive
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's/foo/bar/g'

# Sed colorize match
echo "color test" | sed 's,color,\x1b[31m&\x1b[0m,'

# Remove duplicate lines while keeping the order of the lines
cat -n out.txt | sort -k2 -k1n  | uniq -f1 | sort -nk1,1 | cut -f2-
```


## Helpfull commands


### 1/ Produce

* find
  * `find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's/\bart\b/dispatch/g'`
* ls
  * `ls -1 | xargs -l echo`
* cat, tac
* yes
* seq
  * `seq 10 | xargs -l echo "hello"`
* for

### 2/ Filter

* grep
  * -o: print only match
  * -nri: prefix with line number, recurse, ignore case
* sed
* awk
  * `awk '$2 ~ /[-.0-9]*/ {n++;sum+=$2} END {print n?sum/n:0}'  # Get column 2 average`
* head
  * `head -n 20  # Line`
* tail
  * `tail -n +1 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  # Cat all files, including filename`
* cut
  * `cut -f1,3 -d":" /etc/passwd`
* sort
  * `sort -nr -t '|' -k 2`
  * -h: human: read k as kilo
  * -n: numeric: put 4 before 10
  * -k -t: specify column and delimiter
* uniq
* tr
  * `tr '()' '[]'`

### 3/ Consume

* xargs
  * -l: one command per line (usually what you want)
  * -0: from null terminated (use with find -print0)
* bash
* tee
* while
* od
* mv, cp
* read, readarray
  * `read -r -t 0.001 -d '' msg < <(echo -e "toto\ntiti")  # Slurp to whole file`


# Forking pipeline

In order to have multiple consumers, it can be usefull to fork the pipeline with, at your choice:

1. embeded redirections
2. command substitution
3. command 'tee'
3. internal 'exec'

Let's define simple producer and cosumer

```bash
producer(){ echo "Producer ${*:-0}!"; }
consumer(){ sed "s/.*/Consumer ${*:-0}: &/"; }
```

## Left fork

Serves to redirect the input from multiple commands

```text
+------------+
| Producer 1 |
+------------+
              \     +----------+
               |--> | Consumer |
              /     +----------+
+------------+
| Producer 2 |
+------------+
```

__Simply__: use curly braces `{}` to join them

```bash
{ producer 1; producer 2; } | consumer
```

__Permanently__: use exec and process substitution
(if you want an open shell with the consumer in background)

```bash
exec > >(consumer)
producer 1
producer 2
```

Note: the consumer is writting to stdout and the stdout was overwritten by the consumer. But this is OK because the consumer copied the initial stdout which was, at this moment, pointing to the tty.

Note: the consumer is in a process substitution, so in a child process. modifying the consumer function in the parent shell (your terminal) have no effect anymore, you would have to create a new redirection to see the change applied.

The terminal lost its normal stdout. It would be nice to see it in parallel. For that, we must spawn multiple consumer => see next section: right fork.


## Right fork

Serves to redirect the output to multiple commands

```text
                +------------+
                | Consumer 1 |
                +------------+
+----------+   /
| Producer |--|
+----------+   \
                +------------+
                | Consumer 2 |
                +------------+
```

__Simply__: use tee and process substitution

```bash
producer | tee >(consumer 1) >(consumer 2) > /dev/null
```

__Permanently__: use exec, tee and process substitution

```bash
exec > >(tee >(consumer 1) >(consumer 2) > /dev/null)
producer
```

__Canonically__:

```bash
exec {fd}> >(:)  # Open fd to avoid redirection failure
exec > >(tee >(cat >&"$fd"))  # Writing to 1 will also write to 3
producer
```


## Complex fork

This real world example is using forked redirection to permit Inter-Process Communication between Child and Parent.
This old technique is often used with named pipes (aka fifo), but I find anonymous pipes more elegants.

```text
         Child space        '         Parent space
----------------------------'----------------------------
+---------+                 '
| Child 1 |                 '
+---------+                 '
           \    +--------+  '   +--------+
+---------+ \   | fd_msg | -'-> | fd_msg |     +--------+
| Child 2 | --> +--------+  '   +--------+ --> | Parent |
+---------+ /   | Stdout | -'-> | fd_out |     +--------+
           /    +--------+  '   +--------+
+---------+                 '
| Child 3 |                 '
+---------+                 '
```

```bash
# Declare used function
child(){
  echo "Child ${*:-0} working"
  [[ -v fd_msg ]] && echo "Child ${*:-0}: messaging parent" >&"$fd_msg"
}
slurp_fd(){
  IFS= read -r -t 0.001 -d '' msg <&"$1"
  echo "${msg%$'\n'}"
}

exec {fd_save_stdout}>&1 # Backup standard output fd
exec {fd_msg}<> >(:)  # Create dummy fd for special message
exec {fd_stdout}<> >(:)  # Create dummy fd for all

exec > >(tee >(cat >&"$fd_stdout"))  # Redirect stdout

child 1& child 2& child 3 # Fork them

exec >&"$fd_save_stdout"  # Restore stdout (before wait or wait blocks)

wait  # Wait for children

echo -e "Stdout grabbed:\n$(slurp_fd "$fd_stdout")"  # Read stdout from children
echo -e "Message grabbed:\n$(slurp_fd "$fd_msg")"  # Read message from children
```


# SubProcess control

## Capture output

TODO

## Fork join

```bash
# Define a worker function
worker(){
  : 'Special 12 and 13'
  local -i num=${1:-0} i=0
  local -i color=$((num % 5 + 30))
  if (( 12 == num )); then return 42; fi
  if (( 13 == num )); then while :; do echo -e "worker \e[1m\e[${color}m$num\e[0m: working $((i++))."; sleep 1; done; return 0; fi
  for i in {1..5}; do
    echo -e "worker \e[1m\e[${color}m$num\e[0m: working $i/5."
    sleep 0.1
  done
}
worker 1


multiwork(){
  declare id=''  # The key
  declare -gA d_pid=() d_ret=() d_out=() d_fd=()  # The process infos
  declare -i i_fd=0  # The process stdout filedescriptor

  # Fork
  for id; do
    exec {i_fd}< <(worker "$id")  # <----- 1.0 Here is the async fork
    d_pid[$id]=$!                 # <----- 1.1 Grab its PID
    d_fd[$id]=$i_fd               # <----- 1.2 Grab its FD
  done

  # Join
  for id; do
    wait "${d_pid[$id]}"          # <------ 2.0 Here is the async join
    d_ret[$id]=$?                 # <------ 2.1 Get the exit status
    d_out[$id]=$(cat <&"${d_fd[$id]}")  # < 2.2 Get the stdout
  done

  # Clean
  for id; do exec {d_fd[$id]}<&-; done
                                 # <------- 3.0 Close FD

  # Log
  >&2 echo "Summary: ${d_pid[*]} | Ret: ${d_ret[*]} | Out: ${d_out[*]//$'\n'/:}"
}
multiwork 1 12 2
```


# References and tips

## File descriptor operations

```bash
declare -i fd

exec {fd}<> /tmp/file  # Open fd
echo value >&"$fd"     # Write to fd
cat <&"$fd"            # Read from fd
exec {fd}>&-           # Close fd
```

### Tip: Catch the output of subcommands

```bash
declare -i fd

exec {fd}>&1
declare out=$(echo "Hello world" | tee "/dev/fd/$fd")
exec {fd}>&-
echo "$out"

shopt -s lastpipe; set +m  # permit last pipe command to execute in current shell; disable Monitor mode (i.e. job control)
{ echo -e "begin\ngrepme\nend" | tee /dev/fd/3 | sed -n '/grepme/p' | readarray -t a_filter; } 3>&1; echo "${a_filter[*]}"

# Or faster
{ echo "Hello world" | tee "/dev/fd/$fd"; } {fd}>&1

# Also:
echo "Hello world" | tee /dev/tty
echo "Hello world" | tee >(cat - >&{fd})
```

### Tip: pipe one line

```bash
logger(){ for i in {1..100}; do echo "$i"; sleep 0.1; done; }

logger | xargs -I % echo -ne "\r" "%"

pipe_one_line(){
  {
    local line
    tput rmam
    while read -r line; do
      printf "\r\e[K%s" "$line"
    done < "${1:-/dev/stdin}"
    tput smam
  }
}
logger | pipe_one_line


while true; do date; sleep 1; done | stdbuf --output=0 tr '\n' '\r'
```
